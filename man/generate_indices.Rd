\arguments{
\item{model_output}{List. Output of \code{run_model()}.}

\item{quantiles}{vector of quantiles to be sampled from the posterior
distribution Defaults to c(0.025,0.05,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.95,0.975)}

\item{regions}{vector selecting regional compilation(s) to calculate. Default
is "continent" and "stratum". Options also include "country", "prov_state",
"bcr", and "bcr_by_country" for the stratifications that include areas that
align with those regions.}

\item{regions_index}{Data frame. Index of how strata line up with regions.}

\item{alternate_n}{text string indicating the name of the alternative annual
index parameter in a model, Default is "n", alternatives are "n2" which
involves a different way of scaling the annual indices, "nsmooth" for the
gam and gamye models which show only the smooth component of the
trajectory, and "nslope" for the slope models which track only the linear
slope component of the model}

\item{start_year}{Optional first year for which to calculate the annual
indices if a trajectory for only the more recent portion of the time series
is desired. This is probably most relevant if max_backcast is set and so
trajectories for different time-periods could include a different subset of
strata (i.e., strata removed)}

\item{drop_exclude}{logical indicating if the strata that exceed the
max_backcast threshold should be excluded from the calculations, Default is
FALSE (regions are flagged and listed but not dropped)}

\item{max_backcast}{an optional integer indicating the maximum number of
years to backcast the stratum-level estimates before the first year in
which the species was observed on any route in that stratum. 5 is used in
the CWS national estimates. If the observed data in a given stratum do not
include at least one non-zero observation of the species between the first
year of the BBS and start_year+max_backcast, the stratum is flagged within
the relevant regional summary. Default value, NULL ignores any backcasting
limit (i.e., generates annual indices for the entire time series,
regardless of when the species was first observed)}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Suppress progress messages? Default \code{FALSE}}

\item{jags_mod}{Defunct. Use \code{model_output} instead}

\item{jags_data}{Defunct.}

\item{alt_region_names}{Defunct. Use \code{regions_index} instead}

\item{startyear}{Deprecated. Use \code{start_year} instead}
}
\value{
List of 6 objects
\item{data_summary}{dataframe with the following columns}
\item{Year}{Year of particular index}
\item{Region}{Region name}
\item{Region_alt}{Long name for region}
\item{Region_type}{Type of region including continental, national,Province_State,BCR, bcr_by_country, or stratum}
\item{Strata_included}{Strata included in the annual index calculations}
\item{Strata_excluded}{Strata potentially excluded from the annual index calculations because they have no observations of the species in the first part of the time series, see arguments max_backcast and start_year}
\item{Index}{Strata-weighted count index}
\item{additional columns for each of the values in quantiles}{quantiles of the posterior distribution}
\item{obs_mean}{Mean of the observed annual counts of birds across all routes and all years. An alternative estimate of the average relative abundance of the species in the region and year. Differences between this and the annual indices are a function of the model. For composite regions (i.e., anything other than stratum-level estimates) this average count is calculated as an area-weighted average across all strata included}
\item{nrts}{Number of BBS routes that contributed data for this species, region, and year}
\item{nrts_total}{Number of BBS routes that contributed data for this species and region for all years in the selected time-series, i.e., all years since \code{start_year}}
\item{nnzero}{Number of BBS routes on which this species was observed (i.e., count is > 0) in this region and year}
\item{backcast_flag}{approximate annual average proportion of the covered species range that is free of extrapolated population trajectories. e.g., 1.0 = data cover full time-series, 0.75 = data cover 75 percent of time-series. Only calculated if max_backcast != NULL}

\item{samples}{array of all posterior draws}
\item{area-weights}{data frame of the strata names and area weights used to calculate the continental estimates}
\item{y_min}{first year used in the summary, scale 1:length of time-series}
\item{y_max}{last year used in the summary, scale 1:length of time-series}
\item{start_year}{first year used in the summary, scale 1966:2018}
}
\description{
Calculate annual indices of relative abundance by year for different regions.
These indices can then be used to plot population trajectories for the
species, and to estimate trends.

\examples{

# Toy example with Pacific Wren sample data
# First, stratify the sample data
s <- stratify(by = "bbs_cws", sample_data = TRUE)

# Prepare the stratified data for use in modelling
d <- prepare_data(s,
                  min_year = 2009,
                  max_year = 2018)

# Now run the model (fast but not good, just for illustration)
m <- run_model(d, model = "first_diff",
               iter_sampling = 20, iter_warmup = 20, chains = 2)

# Generate the continental and stratum indices
i <- generate_indices(model_output = m)

# Generate only country indices
i_nat <- generate_indices(model_output = m, regions = "country")
